# Customer-Segmentation
Customer segmentation is a key technique for transforming current business plans. Leveraging advanced methods like KMeans clustering and PCA, this project meticulously categorises customers into four key segments: transactors, revolvers, new customers, and VIP/prime customers. Transactors exhibit good financial practices and are careful spenders, whereas revolvers use credit cards as loans. VIP/Prime Customers are high-spending individuals who are perfect for focused upselling, whereas New Customers are people with low turnover who are ready to sign up for extra services. This segmentation provides organisations with crucial insights into consumer behaviour, allowing them to successfully customise their marketing campaigns and improve customer experiences.
